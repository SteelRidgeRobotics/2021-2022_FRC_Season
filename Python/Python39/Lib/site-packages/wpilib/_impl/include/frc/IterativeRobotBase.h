/**
 * IterativeRobotBase implements a specific type of robot program framework,
 * extending the RobotBase class.
 *
 * The IterativeRobotBase class does not implement StartCompetition(), so it
 * should not be used by teams directly.
 *
 * This class provides the following functions which are called by the main
 * loop, StartCompetition(), at the appropriate times:
 *
 * RobotInit() -- provide for initialization at robot power-on
 *
 * Init() functions -- each of the following functions is called once when the
 *                     appropriate mode is entered:
 *   - DisabledInit()   -- called each and every time disabled is entered from
 *                         another mode
 *   - AutonomousInit() -- called each and every time autonomous is entered from
 *                         another mode
 *   - TeleopInit()     -- called each and every time teleop is entered from
 *                         another mode
 *   - TestInit()       -- called each and every time test is entered from
 *                         another mode
 *
 * Periodic() functions -- each of these functions is called on an interval:
 *   - RobotPeriodic()
 *   - DisabledPeriodic()
 *   - AutonomousPeriodic()
 *   - TeleopPeriodic()
 *   - TestPeriodic()
