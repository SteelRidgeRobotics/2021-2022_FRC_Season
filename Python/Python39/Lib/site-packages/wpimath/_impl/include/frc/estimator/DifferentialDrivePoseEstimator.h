/**
 * This class wraps an Unscented Kalman Filter to fuse latency-compensated
 * vision measurements with differential drive encoder measurements. It will
 * correct for noisy vision measurements and encoder drift. It is intended to be
 * an easy drop-in for DifferentialDriveOdometry. In fact, if you never call
 * AddVisionMeasurement(), and only call Update(), this will behave exactly the
 * same as DifferentialDriveOdometry.
 *
 * Update() should be called every robot loop (if your robot loops are faster or
 * slower than the default, then you should change the nominal delta time via
 * the constructor).
 *
 * AddVisionMeasurement() can be called as infrequently as you want; if you
 * never call it, then this class will behave like regular encoder odometry.
 *
 * Our state-space system is:
 *
 * <strong> x = [[x, y, theta, dist_l, dist_r]]^T </strong> in the field
 * coordinate system.
 *
 * <strong> u = [[d_l, d_r, dtheta]]^T </strong> (robot-relative velocities) --
 * NB: using velocities make things considerably easier, because it means that
 * teams don't have to worry about getting an accurate model. Basically, we
 * suspect that it's easier for teams to get good encoder data than it is for
 * them to perform system identification well enough to get a good model
 *
 * <strong>y = [[x, y, theta]]^T </strong> from vision,
 * or <strong>y = [[dist_l, dist_r, theta]] </strong> from encoders and gyro.
