class TrapezoidProfileRadians():
    """
    A trapezoid-shaped velocity profile.

    While this class can be used for a profiled movement from start to finish,
    the intended usage is to filter a reference's dynamics based on trapezoidal
    velocity constraints. To compute the reference obeying this constraint, do
    the following.

    Initialization::

      constraints = TrapezoidProfile.Constraints(kMaxV, kMaxA)
      previousProfiledReference = initialReference

    Run on update::

      profile = TrapezoidProfile(constraints, unprofiledReference, previousProfiledReference)
      previousProfiledReference = profile.calculate(timeSincePreviousUpdate)

    where ``unprofiledReference`` is free to change between calls. Note that
    when the unprofiled reference is within the constraints,
    :meth:`calculate` returns the unprofiled reference unchanged.

    Otherwise, a timer can be started to provide monotonic values for
    ``calculate()`` and to determine when the profile has completed via
    :meth:`isFinished`.
