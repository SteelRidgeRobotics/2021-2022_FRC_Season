pyfrc - RobotPy development library helper
==========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robotpy/pyfrc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/robotpy/pyfrc)

pyfrc is a python 3 library designed to make developing python code using WPILib for
FIRST Robotics Competition easier.

This library contains a few primary parts:

* A built-in uploader that will upload your robot code to the robot
* Integration with the py.test testing tool to allow you to easily write unit
  tests for your robot code.
* Various support for robot simulation
