class StateMachine:
    '''
    The StateMachine class is used to implement magicbot components that
    allow one to easily define a `finite state machine (FSM)
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine>`_ that can be
    executed via the magicbot framework.

    You create a component class that inherits from ``StateMachine``.
    Each state is represented as a single function, and you indicate that
    a function is a particular state by decorating it with one of the
    following decorators:

    * :func:`@default_state <.default_state>`
    * :func:`@state <.state>`
    * :func:`@timed_state <.timed_state>`

    As the state machine executes, the decorated function representing the
    current state will be called. Decorated state functions can receive the
    following parameters (all of which are optional):

    - ``tm`` - The number of seconds since autonomous has started
    - ``state_tm`` - The number of seconds since this state has been active
      (note: it may not start at zero!)
    - ``initial_call`` - Set to True when the state is initially called,
      False otherwise. If the state is switched to multiple times, this
      will be set to True at the start of each state.

    To be consistent with the magicbot philosophy, in order for the
    state machine to execute its states you must call the :func:`engage`
    function upon each execution of the main robot control loop. If you do
    not call this function, then execution of the FSM will cease.

    .. note:: If you wish for the FSM to continue executing state functions
              regardless whether ``engage()`` is called, you must set the
              ``must_finish`` parameter in your state decorator to be True.

    When execution ceases (because ``engage()`` was not called), the
    :func:`done` function will be called and the FSM will be reset to the
    starting state. The state functions will not be called again unless
    ``engage`` is called.

    As a magicbot component, StateMachine contains an ``execute`` function that
    will be called on each control loop. All state execution occurs from
    within that function call. If you call other components from a
    StateMachine, you should ensure that your StateMachine is declared
    *before* the other components in your Robot class.

    .. warning:: As StateMachine already contains an execute function,
                 there is no need to define your own ``execute`` function for
                 a state machine component -- if you override ``execute``,
                 then the state machine may not work correctly. Instead,
                 use the :func:`@default_state <.default_state>` decorator.

    Here's a very simple example of how you might implement a shooter
    automation component that moves a ball into a shooter when the
    shooter is ready::

        class ShooterAutomation(magicbot.StateMachine):

            # Some other component
            shooter: Shooter
            ball_pusher: BallPusher

            def fire(self):
                """This is called from the main loop."""
                self.engage()

            @state(first=True)
            def begin_firing(self):
                """
                This function will only be called IFF fire is called and
                the FSM isn't currently in the 'firing' state. If fire
                was not called, this function will not execute.
                """
                self.shooter.enable()
                if self.shooter.ready():
                    self.next_state('firing')
